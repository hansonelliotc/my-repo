		<h2>Planetoids</h2>
		<img src="files/planetoids.png">
		<p>
		Planetoids is a competitive print-and-play board game for 2-4 players.
		Players vie for dominance over the precious crystal deposits without exhausting their resources too quickly. 
		Planetoids has an abundance of strategic depth while still being approachable with a simple ruleset. 
		Will you play a game of risky dice rolls with big rewards, or will you take a slower, more calculated path to victory? The choice is yours.
		</p>
		<p>It is available for purchase on <a href="https://elliothanson.itch.io/planetoids" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

		<h2>Song</h2>

		<p>
		Song is my eclectic art project I worked on in my free time during the spring semester of 2024. 
		It is an 18-card solitaire print-and-play game. 
		I took advantage of this opportunity to experiment with the medium and try something new that might not have widespread appeal.

		<p>It is available for free on <a href="https://elliothanson.itch.io/song" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>
